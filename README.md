# World Cup Database

## Description
This was a project required to complete freeCodeCamp's *Relational Database* certification. For this project, users must create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.
- *worldcup.sql* is a dump of the database and shows the commands and data that comprises it.
- *insert_data.sh* is the script that enters the necessary data into the database.
- *queries.sh* is a list of queries that had to be created to match the requests for data described in the user stories.
